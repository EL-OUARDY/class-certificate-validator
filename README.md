# Class Certificate Validator App

`Python`
`Flask`

## Introduction

I built this website for my students after completing a 12-week class at a youth center in my town, in collaboration with Peace Corps volunteers. It highlights the activities we did in class and the curriculum we followed. The site also includes a simple algorithm using Flask to validate issued certificates, allowing direct QR code scanning on the certificates.

## Installation

1- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EL-OUARDY/class-certificate-validator.git
```

2- Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd certificate-validator
```

3- Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

4- Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

5- Install python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6- Start the application

```bash
flask run --debug
```
